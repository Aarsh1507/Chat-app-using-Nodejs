            >In this tutorial, we will use the Node.js platform to build a real-time chat application that sends and shows messages to a recipient instantly without any page refresh. Also, we have some validations like if the username is taken then we will have to choose some other username. If two users are in the same room then only they can see the message of each other</p
          >
          <p
            >In this tutorial, I will show how I built my news app using React
            JS. So what is special in this 3-page application? You can take any
            API and fetch data using Axios and render it in view. I am writing a
            blog on this because I am using RSS Feed of ABP News and Aaj Tak
            news, where I am getting data in XML format. Seems interesting
            right? Let's get&nbsp;started.</p

            >You will need Node 6+ installed on your machine. Some knowledge of
            JavaScript and React will be&nbsp;helpful.</p
          >
          <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
          <p
            >To follow along, a basic knowledge of JavaScript (ES6) and React is
            required. You also need to have the following installed on
            your&nbsp;machine:</p
          >
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> (v6
              and&nbsp;above)</li
            >
            <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Getting started</h3>
          <p
            >Start by creating a new empty directory news-app and run npm init
            -y from within it in order to initialize the project with a
            package.json file.</p
          >
          <h3>Set up the React&nbsp;app</h3>
          <p
            >We will bootstrap our React application with create-react-app.
            Install it globally on your computer by running the following
            command:</p
          >
          <pre>npm install -g create-react-app</pre>
          <p
            >Once the installation process is done, you can run the command
            below within the news-app directory to set up your React
            application:</p
          >
          <pre>create-react-app NewsApp</pre>
          <p
            >Once the command has finished running, cd into the newly created
            NewsApp folder and install the other dependencies we will be needing
            to build the app frontend.</p
          >
          <p>So we will be creating mainly 3 components</p>
          <ol
            ><li>
              <strong>NewsCategory: </strong>It will display different types of
              categories in news app such as world news, sports, business,
              etc.</li
            ></ol
          >
          <p
            ><strong>2. NewsList: </strong>It will display a list of all news
            from the specified category.</p
          >
          <p
            ><strong>3. NewsDetail: </strong>It will display detailed news from
            the list when the user clicks on any&nbsp;news.</p
          >
          <p>So let's go one by one through all the components</p>
          <h4><strong>1. NewsCategory</strong></h4>
          <p
            >We will use the class component as we want to manage different
            categories in this component, and when users click on any category
            that should be passed down as props to the NewsList component. So we
            will manage our category as an object of key-value pair in
            the&nbsp;state.</p
          >
          <a
            href="https://medium.com/media/b8f59e98cfc94ab5dfcec40b048a9851/href"
            >https://medium.com/media/b8f59e98cfc94ab5dfcec40b048a9851/href</a
          ><p
            >So we are managing category in state object with type key and URL
            for that category is stored in category URL which we will use in our
            API call. Now note that we are using routing here. First, we are
            looping through all categories. Then we are passing down selected
            categories in Route itself as a state&nbsp;object.</p
          >
          <h4><strong>2. News List Component</strong></h4>
          <p
            >This is our core component where we will perform our major
            operations. We will make an API request and get a response. We will
            parse our XML response to JSON and then we will send this response
            to our post detail for the selected&nbsp;post</p
          >
          <a
            href="https://medium.com/media/2d2aa6c608a7097dd470161a63ae452a/href"
            >https://medium.com/media/2d2aa6c608a7097dd470161a63ae452a/href</a
          ><p
            ><strong>Step 1:</strong> Going from the beginning, first of all we
            are setting our states using React Hooks. Next, we are setting our
            Category state with the props which we passed from the Route of
            NewsCategory component.</p
          >
          <p
            ><strong>Step2:</strong> Next, we make an API call with our complete
            URL which we got from step 1. Now as I said we will get a response
            in XML format. So the next step is to parse it in
            JSON&nbsp;format</p
          >
          <p
            ><strong>Step3: </strong>To parse our response in JSON format we are
            using npm library <strong>react-XML-parser. </strong>We are passing
            our data to it and it will give some JSON response which will not
            the exactly same we are expecting. Now before we move to next step
            take a look at the below response that I am getting
            after&nbsp;parsing:</p
          >
          <figure
            ><img
              alt=""
              src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PwZ5Tm14yUsCjeIhXmkcMg.png" /></figure
          ><p
            ><strong>Step-4: </strong>Now we need to go to the nested level to
            get our desired&nbsp;data.</p
          >
          <figure
            ><img
              alt=""
              src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ONQIiFL4ywwL3z1xykELsw.png" /></figure
          ><p
            >Now, we notice that our starting 8 objects are JSON response of our
            XML configuration. So our actual data starts from Object 9 onwards.
            So we need to filter this out and then we need to set our states.
            This is where we are looping through all the children and checking
            whether they are empty or have any value and storing all those
            objects in a new&nbsp;array.</p
          >
          <p
            ><strong>Step5: </strong>To render all our post we are using map
            function and using nav link to link each newsCard to our newsDetail
            component where we can visit our NewsDetail for a particular card
            when user click on any news&nbsp;card</p
          >
          <h4>3. News Detail Component</h4>
          <p
            >In this component, we are fetching state from the history object of
            the route which we passed in the route of the NewsList component.</p
          >
          <a
            href="https://medium.com/media/53e50024f82535c4207688c87cf677d2/href"

          ><p
            >Here we will store our props that we get from the route in our
            state. Note that here we are storing our props in a state as we want
            to maintain state even if user refresh the page, we don't want to
            lose the state that we get from the news&nbsp;list</p

          ><h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
          <p
            >There we have it, we just created our own news app which connects
            to a third-party API. We also learned how to parse XML to JSON in
            React JS. There’s a lot of additional features you can add to the
            app, such as a news feed with trending articles and the ability for
            a user to filter by time or location. If you got lost during the
            way, you can find the source code for the final
            project&nbsp;below.</p

            >I hope this tutorial will help beginner React developers to learn
            new concepts like connecting to a third-party API, working with a UI
            component framework, and hopefully also the overall development of a
            simple React application. Thanks for&nbsp;reading!</p
